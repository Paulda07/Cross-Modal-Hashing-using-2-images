This Model is an adaptation of jiangqy/DCMH-CVPR2017 project on Deep Cross Modal Hashing.

In this project, I converted the image-text modality present in the DCMH-CVPR2017 work to a image-image modality.

The dataset is a composed of 100 iris pictures (left iris) and 100 face pictures. These 100 are of 10 different people and assigned 10 labels accordingly.

To run this project- Run the demo.py file after download.


The retrieval accuracy obtained on this small dataset (10 people, 100 images iris, 100 images face) was 100% from face->iris and 97.8% from iris->face retrievals.
